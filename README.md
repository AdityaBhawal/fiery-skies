This is a small game I made in 2018 in less than 24 hours at CodeDay Los Angeles, a hackathon for K-12 students!

Play on your mobile device by inserting your phone in a Cardboard VR headset: https://vr.google.com/cardboard/.

Look around to see enemy ships, tapping the sides of the steering pole to turn and the cannons to shoot!

Try to survive for as long as you can!
